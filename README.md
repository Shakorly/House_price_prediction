# House_price_prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model built with PyTorch to predict house prices based on input features. The model uses a neural network architecture and has been trained and validated to achieve good performance, as demonstrated by the loss and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) plots over epochs.

Overview
Purpose: Predict house prices using a deep learning approach with numerical input features.
Framework: Built with PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.
Performance:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Approximately 0.35–0.45 after training.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Around 0.2022 after training.
R-squared (R²): Approximately 0.5999, indicating moderate explanatory power.
The model shows a steady decrease in both training and validation loss/MAE, converging after around 40–50 epochs.
Features: Includes training, validation, plotting of loss and MAE, and evaluation metrics.
